# BusinessAnalysisProject2 

In this project, I will be querying the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. 

## What is the Project All About?

For the project, I will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. I will ask some business related questions and answer them through the data I pull from the database.

## What skills will I use?

The main goal of this project is for me to demonstrate my ability to:

- Write error-free SQL queries
- use Joins and subqueries correctly in SQL queries
- Use aggregations correctly in SQL queries

## The Resulting File For The Project Will include:

- Four slides presentation in PDF with one visualization per slide
- A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide insight
- The SQL query I used to create the data used in the visualization. 
- I also included  the database used and the results from the SQL queries
